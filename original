Once upon a time there was a land where everyone was very happy. Each person was born with a magic bag which contained an endless supply of warm fuzzies. When these were handed out to other people, they were like the touch of a small childâ€™s hand - so that people felt warmth and caring whenever they received a fuzzy. And because the bags were magic, everyone could ask for and get as many warm fuzzies as they wanted.

One day a wicked witch arrived and started a rumour that there would not always be enough fuzzies in the bags. (The witch wanted to sell potions that bring happiness so the free fuzzy supplies were very bad for business.) People started to hold their fuzzies back in case the rumour was true, so just as in the financial markets they ended up causing it to become true.

Now the land was not so happy. People gave out fuzzies only sparingly, and even then they wanted one in return each time. Someone invented cold pricklies, which stimulated unpleasant feelings but at least reminded people that they were alive. The wicked witch made a lot of money selling misery cures.

A group of people got together and invented plastic fuzzies, where it felt for a moment as if a warm fuzzy had been received but then it became apparent that there was no real feeling behind it from the giver.

Eventually a wise traveller came along, saw what had happened and told people that the bags WERE magic and that the more warm fuzzies they gave out, the more would be generated. Some people started to believe the traveller and began to give out more fuzzies. We are now waiting to see them succeed in changing the fuzzy-giving pattern for the better.
